## INTRODUCTION: 
Social Buzz is a rapidly growing social media company with over 500 million active users per month, they now also generate  more than 100,000 unstructured data; these pieces of content which are posted daily comprise texts, images, videos and GIFs.

Due to this rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they create, collect and must analyze is huge so, In a bid to effectively understand how the world's biggest companies manage the challenges of big data and because they do not have the resources to manage the scale that they are currently at, they have hired and want to learn data best practices from people who are experienced and are part of a large corporation.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
- 500 million active monthly users
- More than 100,000 unstructured data items are generated every day.
- Which categories of these contents appeal to its audience the most?
- Which top 5 content categories are the most popular for improved interaction and direct future content production?

## **TOOL USED: Microsoft Excel**

## *THE ANALYSIS PROCESS*
1. **Data understanding and Requirements gathering:** 7 datasets and a data model were provided. Each data set contains different columns and values and the data model  shows the relationships between all of the data sets.
The first step I took was to use the data model to identify which datasets would be required to answer the business questions.
2. **Data cleaning:** When working with data, one common and important task is data cleaning;
-	I removed rows that have values which are missing,
-	I changed the data type of some values within a column, and
-	I removed columns that are not relevant to this task.
3.	**Data modelling:** A final data set was created by merging relevant tables.

After carrying out the above processes using some formulas like ‘VLOOKUP’, ‘Sum If’, etc, I had my spreadsheet containing the answer to ‘the top 5 categories of contents’ question and also a cleaned dataset for ease of insight uncovering.
